</p>

The project is about a fictional app *GIOLAQ Music* ( Not I'm not an actual singer üë®‚Äçüé§ )

That you can use to buy:
- The right to play the whole album of GIOLAQ
- The yearly subscription to all the music produced by GIOLAQ
- Tickets granting you access to GIOLAQ live music concerts (one ticket per concert)

These three in-app purchases correspond respectively to the three types of IAP
supported by the Amazon Appstore:

- Consumables: Purchase that is made, then consumed within the app, such as extra lives, extra moves, or in-game currency. May be purchased multiple times.
- Entitlements: One-time purchase to unlock access to features or content within an app or game.
- Subscriptions: Offers access to a premium set of content or features for a limited period of time.

   ```sh
   adb shell setprop debug.amazon.sandboxmode debug
   ```
6. Install the IAP app tester from the Amazon appstore. 
7. Build and run the Flutter app from your IDE setting as a target your Fire Tablet device.

## Using the Sample App
At first start you will see the music page but you have no Play button as you have no purchases.

Head to purchase page to purchase one of the three different IAP
- Music Album
- Yearly subscription
- Ticket

Music Album and Yearly subscription will unlock the music in the music screen.

Ticket will increase the ticket counter in the music screen
You can consume the ticket tapping on the ticket icon
